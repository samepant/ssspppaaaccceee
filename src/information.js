            <p><span className='names'>SPACE SPACE SPACE</span> is a three-day gathering centering around alternative pedagogy, self-organizing, and exploring ways of disrupting the productions of knowledge within academic structures. From March 29-31, 2018, SPACE SPACE SPACE will bring together various Detroit-based/affiliated thinkers and creators leading workshops on a variety of issues and strategies including systems of education within the prison industrial complex, the effects of space on bodies and physiology, community building through participatory dinners, and decolonization within design practices. The gathering will be held within an autonomous inflatable plastic structure sited on but not within the architecture of the Cranbrook Academy of Art campus in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.</p>
            <p>The gathering will include daily dinner events, and Cranbrook Academy of Art students and guests will be invited to make use of the inflatable structure during the gathering as a temporary commons to facilitate events/workshops that critically engage the structure and function of pedagogy and community within the Academy. Space3 is organized by a group of Cranbrook students and alumni whose interest stems from a desire to respond to the contained nature of the academy and to reimagine its relationship to the Detroit metro area. A desired outcome of this gathering would be to inspire a continued dialogue and collaboration between Cranbrook and Detroit-based artists and educators.</p>

              <p>This presentation and discussion will focus on systems of education as they relate to the prison industrial complex; the state of education and arts based programming in prisons today, strategies for resisting the impediments of carceral logic as it pertains to education behind bars, and collaborative pedagogical processes between incarcerated and non-incarcerated people by which change can be created for the benefit of all.</p>

              <p>Using Gloria House's book Tower and Dungeon as a framework we will be exploring the connections between real estate development of Downtown Detroit, gentrification, the prison industrial complex and Cranbrook. We will take a macro analysis of how it effects the region and a micro analysis of how space effects bodies and physiology.</p>

              <p>We will lead a discussion about the role of graphic design in extending neoliberalism in this stage of capitalism. We will also talk about how to work against that, toward a decolonial design practice, and what that might look like.</p>
